the sv2tts needs to be multithreaded
if there is no audio like when the user is muted there will be problem in sv2tts
each user needs to have their own folder in tts folder
in sv2tts check for restart before send messages
bot get stuck when user dont speak and the input is less than 4 character

permissions=8336

and this is for config
    "token"
    "id"
    "username": "Two T",
    "channel_name": "two-tðŸ¦œ"
